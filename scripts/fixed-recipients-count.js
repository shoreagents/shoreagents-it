// Fixed: Recipients Count Now Updates in Realtime
// Added assigned_user_ids to database trigger payload and proper handling in frontend

console.log('🔧 Fixed: Recipients Count Now Updates in Realtime')
console.log('')

console.log('❌ Previous Issue:')
console.log('   - Database trigger didn\'t include assigned_user_ids in payload')
console.log('   - Realtime updates didn\'t update recipients count')
console.log('   - Count only updated on page reload')
console.log('   - Not consistent with events page behavior')
console.log('')

console.log('✅ Fixed Implementation:')
console.log('   - Added assigned_user_ids to INSERT payload in database trigger')
console.log('   - Added assigned_user_ids to UPDATE payload in database trigger')
console.log('   - Added assigned_user_ids to DELETE payload in database trigger')
console.log('   - Updated frontend to properly handle assigned_user_ids in realtime updates')
console.log('   - Added fallback to preserve existing assigned_user_ids if not provided')
console.log('')

console.log('📋 How It Works Now:')
console.log('   1. User creates/updates announcement with recipients')
console.log('   2. Database trigger fires with assigned_user_ids in payload')
console.log('   3. Realtime hook receives update with recipients data')
console.log('   4. Frontend updates announcement state with new recipients')
console.log('   5. Recipients count updates instantly without page reload!')
console.log('')

console.log('🎯 Database Changes:')
console.log('   ✅ INSERT: assigned_user_ids included in payload')
console.log('   ✅ UPDATE: assigned_user_ids included in payload')
console.log('   ✅ DELETE: assigned_user_ids included in payload')
console.log('')

console.log('🎯 Frontend Changes:')
console.log('   ✅ onAnnouncementSent: Preserves assigned_user_ids')
console.log('   ✅ onAnnouncementUpdated: Updates assigned_user_ids')
console.log('   ✅ onAnnouncementDeleted: Handles assigned_user_ids')
console.log('   ✅ Fallback logic to prevent data loss')
console.log('')

console.log('🚀 Test It:')
console.log('   1. Open /admin/announcements')
console.log('   2. Create/edit announcement with recipients')
console.log('   3. Watch recipients count update instantly!')
console.log('   4. No more page reload needed for count updates')
