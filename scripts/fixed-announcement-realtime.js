// Fixed: Announcement Page Realtime Implementation
// The issue was that the announcement page was calling fetchAnnouncements() 
// instead of updating the state directly like other pages do.

console.log('🔧 Fixed: Announcement Page Realtime Implementation')
console.log('')

console.log('❌ Previous Issue:')
console.log('   - Called fetchAnnouncements() on every realtime update')
console.log('   - Caused full page refresh and API calls')
console.log('   - Not following the pattern used by events/tickets pages')
console.log('')

console.log('✅ Fixed Implementation:')
console.log('   - onAnnouncementSent: Updates state directly with setAnnouncements()')
console.log('   - onAnnouncementExpired: Updates announcement status in state')
console.log('   - onAnnouncementUpdated: Updates announcement in state')
console.log('   - handleSend: Updates state immediately after API call')
console.log('')

console.log('📋 How It Works Now (Following Events/Tickets Pattern):')
console.log('   1. Realtime updates modify the announcements state directly')
console.log('   2. No unnecessary API calls or page refreshes')
console.log('   3. Instant UI updates without loading states')
console.log('   4. Smooth user experience like other pages')
console.log('')

console.log('🎯 Benefits:')
console.log('   ✅ No more page refreshes on realtime updates')
console.log('   ✅ Instant UI updates')
console.log('   ✅ Consistent with events/tickets pages')
console.log('   ✅ Better performance (no unnecessary API calls)')
console.log('   ✅ Smoother user experience')
console.log('')

console.log('🚀 Test It:')
console.log('   1. Open /admin/announcements')
console.log('   2. Send an announcement from another tab')
console.log('   3. Watch it appear instantly without refresh!')
