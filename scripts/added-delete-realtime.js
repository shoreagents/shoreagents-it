// Added: DELETE Operation Support for Announcements
// Now both INSERT and DELETE operations are handled in realtime

console.log('✅ Added: DELETE Operation Support for Announcements')
console.log('')

console.log('🔧 What Was Added:')
console.log('   - onAnnouncementDeleted callback in UseRealtimeAnnouncementsOptions')
console.log('   - DELETE action handling in announcement_change case')
console.log('   - onAnnouncementDeleted callback in announcement page')
console.log('   - Automatic removal from state when announcement is deleted')
console.log('   - Removed manual fetchAnnouncements() call from handleDelete')
console.log('')

console.log('📋 How DELETE Realtime Works:')
console.log('   1. User deletes announcement → Database DELETE')
console.log('   2. Database trigger fires → Sends "announcement_change" with action="DELETE"')
console.log('   3. Hook receives message → Checks action === "DELETE"')
console.log('   4. Calls onAnnouncementDeleted → Removes announcement from state')
console.log('   5. Announcement disappears instantly from the list!')
console.log('')

console.log('🎯 Supported Operations Now:')
console.log('   ✅ INSERT - New announcements appear automatically')
console.log('   ✅ DELETE - Deleted announcements disappear automatically')
console.log('   ✅ UPDATE - Status changes (sent/expired) update automatically')
console.log('   ✅ All operations work in real-time across tabs!')
console.log('')

console.log('🚀 Test DELETE Realtime:')
console.log('   1. Open /admin/announcements in one tab')
console.log('   2. Delete an announcement in another tab')
console.log('   3. Watch it disappear instantly in the first tab!')
console.log('   4. Check browser console for "🗑️ Announcement deleted" message')
